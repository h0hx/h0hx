# Hello, I’m Blake 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am part of DoD (Department of Defense) working as a Tier 1 Analyst.

I’ve been deeply involved in technology since childhood. Growing up around computers sparked a long-term passion for security, problem-solving, and building systems that help make the world a safer place. I enjoy working on security-focused projects, analyzing threats, and continuously improving my technical skill set.

I’m also a software developer who codes regularly in my free time. I enjoy learning new technologies, experimenting with ideas, and building tools simply for the challenge and growth. I’m on a continuous journey to learn anything and everything the tech world has to offer.

Currently, I’m becoming a proficient Go (Golang) programmer, with a strong interest in security-oriented development, backend systems, and performance-driven software.
